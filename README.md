## 🧭 Reading Roadmap for OverRecovered

Welcome to **OverRecovered** — a no-fluff, intensity-first approach to hypertrophy for thinkers who train. If you’re here to perform exercises, chase pump fads, or argue over full ROM dogma… this isn’t for you.

If you're here to **train logically, deeply, and to failure — welcome.**

### 📂 Core Sequence (Read in Order)

1. 🔍 **1. 🔍 [Why do you want the muscles](./Why%20do%20you%20want%20the%20muscles.md)**
   A philosophical filtering mechanism. What’s driving you to train? Vanity, strength, insecurity — or precision self-development?

2. 🧠 **[Muscle Fibers & Nervous System Primer](./Muscle%20Fibers%20&%20Nervous%20System%20Primer.md)**
   Understand what you're *actually* training.

   * Type I vs Type II
   * Fiber recruitment hierarchy
   * CNS fatigue and its misunderstood role

3. 🦴 **[Training Philosophy & Structural Realism](./Training%20Philosophy%20&%20Structural%20Realism.md)**
   Leverage-aware training built around *your* anatomy — not your idol’s.

   * Insertions, bone lengths, joint angles
   * ROM adjustments and accommodation
   * Calisthenics and machines without dogma

4. ❗ **[Myths & Reader Misfires (Q\&A)](./Myths%20&%20Reader%20Misfires.md)**
   Refined responses to common lifting errors and “bro science.”

   * “Don’t I need full ROM?”
   * “What about strength gains?”
   * "Aren’t machines less effective?"

5. 🚀 **Call to Action / What’s Next** *(coming soon)*
